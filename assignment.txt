1. A VARIABLE 
A variable is a name given to a memory location used to store data.
Think of a variable as a container or box where you keep a value.
 (E.g) int age = 20; age is the variable or the container while 20 is the value stored inside it

2A. Difference between int and float 
Integer stores whole numbers (e.g 10)
Float stores decimal numbers(e.g 3.1)

2B. Difference between float and double 
Float stores single or two decimals and it uses less memory
Double stores mulitple decimals and uses more memory 

2C. Difference between char and char array 
Char stores a single character inside double quoat (e.g 'A')
Char array stores mulitple characters (a string) (e.g "john")

3. What are Modifiers in C
Modifiers are keywords used with data types to change their size or range.
Examples:
	•	short
	•	long
	•	signed
	•	unsigned
Purpose: They control how much memory is used and what range of values can be stored.
short int x;
long int y;

4. Constants
A constant is a value that does not change during program execution.
It can be declared using:
const int MAX = 100;
const float PI = 3.142;

5. Format Specifier
A format specifier tells printf or scanf what type of data to display or read.
Examples:Specifier Meaning
%d- Integer
%f-Float
%lf-Double
%c-Character
%s-String

6. Declaration vs Initialization
Declaration means telling the compiler about a variable’s name and type.
Initialization means giving the variable its first value.
Example:
int x;       // declaration
int x = 5;   // initialization
