SECTION A - C PROGRAMMING BASICS
1A. A PROGRAM
A program is a set of instructions that tells a computer what to do.
So we know a computer is like a very fast machine, but it cannot think on its own.
It only does what we tell it — and what we tell it is called a program.
 (e.g) Add two numbers, Control a traffic light etc.

1B. AN ALGORITHM
An algorithm is a step-by-step method for solving a problem.
Before we write code, we must think about the steps to solve the problem. 
(E.g) before we make tea the steps are to boil hot water, put  the beverage in the cup,
 add the hot water etc this are the steps of solving the problem of making a tea

1C. PSEUDOCODE
Pseudocode is writing the algorithm in simple English that 
looks like programming but is not actual code.
It helps programmers plan before writing real code. (E.g) 
START
INPUT two numbers
ADD the numbers
DISPLAY result
END

1D. A FLOWCHART
A flowchart is a diagram that shows the steps of an algorithm 
using shapes and arrows.Instead of writing steps with words, we draw them.

1E. A VARIABLE 
A variable is a name given to a memory location used to store data.
Think of a variable as a container or box where you keep a value.
 (E.g) int age = 20; age is the variable or the container while 20 is the value stored inside it



2. Differences

a. Machine Language and High-Level Language

Machine Language:
- lowest-level programming Language
- Written in binary (0s and 1s)
- Difficult for humans to understand
- Executed directly by the computer

High-Level Language:
- High-level programming Language
- Written in English-like words
- Easy for humans to read and write
- Must be translated before execution

b. Syntax and Semantics
Syntax:
Syntax refers to the rules and structure for writing statements in a programming language.
so Syntaxis about how you write. (e.g) int x =5; (this is correct)
int x5 =; (not correct)

Semantics:
Semantics refers to the meaning or purpose of the statements written in a programming language.
(e.g) x = x + 1;


3. Purpose of #include <stdio.h>
The #include <stdio.h> statement tells the compiler to include the 
Standard Input and Output library so that functions like printf() and scanf() can be used.
If you use printf() or scanf() in your program and you do not include stdio.h,
the compiler will not know what those functions are.
It allows printf() to work. Without it → compiler error or warning.


4. Purpose of return 0;
The return 0; statement indicates that the program has ended successfully.

5. Companies / Applications that use C2q
1. Microsoft — uses C to build parts of the Windows operating system.
2. Apple — uses C in macOS and iOS system-level components.
3. Linux Foundation — uses C to develop the Linux operating system kernel.
