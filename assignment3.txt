(a) What is an operator in C?
An operator in C is a symbol that tells the compiler to 
perform a specific operation on one or more values.


(b) What is an operand?
An operand is the value or variable on which an operator performs its operation.
Example:
a + b 
A and b are operands


(c) What is an expression?
An expression is a combination of variables, constants, 
and operators that produces a result.
Example: x = a + b;


(d) Difference between = and ==
	•	= is the assignment operator used to assign a value.
	•	== is the comparison operator used to check equality.
Example:
x = 5;      // assignment
x == 5;     // comparison


(e) Operator precedence
Operator precedence determines the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression.
Example:
int result = 10 + 5 * 2;


2. Categories of Operators in C
(a) Arithmetic Operators - These are used to perform mathematical calculations like addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.
Examples 
int a = 10, b = 5;

printf("%d\n", a + b);   // Addition
printf("%d\n", a % b);   // Modulus

(b) Assignment Operators
These operators are used to assign values to variables.
Examples:
int x = 10;

x += 5;   // x = x + 5
x *= 2;   // x = x * 2


(c) Relational Operators
These operators are used to compare two values and return true or false.
Examples:
int a = 5, b = 10;

printf("%d\n", a < b);   // Less than
printf("%d\n", a == b);  // Equal to

(d) Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions.
Examples:
int a = 5, b = 10;

printf("%d\n", a < b && b > a);  // Logical AND
printf("%d\n", a > b || b > a);  // Logical OR

(e) Increment and Decrement Operators
These operators are used to increase or decrease a value by one.
Examples:
int x = 5;

x++;   // Increment
x--;   // Decrement
